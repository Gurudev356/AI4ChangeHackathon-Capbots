Problem Statement:

"A major Global Financial Company" needs a better way to find an eligible customer to provide loan to undeserved population by traditional banks by predicting their client's repayment abilities. 

In this challenge we plan to come up with a model which can predict whether a user is able to repay his/her loans based on the past credit history of minimum or no credit and help them unlock the full potential of their data by improving the effectiveness of the predictions, using various statistical and machine learning methods.
